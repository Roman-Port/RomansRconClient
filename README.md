# Romans-Rcon-Client
Welcome to Roman's RCON Client! This is a simple little client that I made in an afternoon because I wasn't satisfied with the other C# clients.

## How do I use it? ##
It's simple! Just download the DLL in releases, import it as a refrence, then use `RconConnection.ConnectToRcon([IP],[PORT],[SERVER PASSWORD]);`.
Take a look at the example for more info.
